# Storage W6–W8 qualification

Local technical qualification completed on 2026-09-14. W6 and W7: 12/12 activities, G2 PASS. W8 technical G3 PASS; PR review/merge remains human. The work item stays IN_PROGRESS until merge under lean lifecycle. W0–W5 is the accepted merged baseline, not reopened.

SP 2.12.0/storage 1.3.0 publishes fixed RENAMES, constant reference modification, textual MOVE fitting and ordered receivers, explicit CORRESPONDING pairs and invocation initial state. Qualified modifiers, observed FUNCTION MOVE fallback and physical VALUE membership have reduced regression tests.

## Validation

Full Maven: 730 tests, 729 passed and one pre-existing opt-in future condition oracle skipped; full normalizer and naming passed. New scale: 1 test/12 shapes. Final corpus fixes: 2 tests plus 32 affected storage regressions.

The composed final G3 retains unchanged green RC2 evidence and requalifies only demonstrated failures at RC3. Source fixes affect formerly crashing/invalid projections; lowering fixes affect formerly invalid entry slices. All 12 affected real programs were re-executed from the affected stage; 55 successful pipelines and six historical blockers were retained. Original failed runs, reduced RED/GREEN, hashes, commands and invalidation proofs are preserved in the local artefatos-e2e campaign archive. No clean builds or unchanged upstream rebuilds were introduced.

Metamorphic qualification: 6 semantic methods, 5 required relations, 2 cross-repo cases. Targeted mutation: 46 executed kills plus 6 historical kills reused with implementation/test/harness equivalence; no surviving or invalid final mutant. All 46 implementation and killer-test files are unchanged by RC3 fixes.

Final CardDemo: all 73 immutable sources, 67 PARTIAL pipelines, 6 unchanged preprocessing/normalization blockers, 73 unchanged literal dependency vectors. No dynamic CALL gain is claimed for this literal-only cohort. Final combined W6/W7 E2E: 7/7, plus 2 metamorphic E2E. Source 12, regional 9 and transport 3 gradual scale scenarios pass; methodology uses JDK21, one local Maven cache, nanoTime/monotonic elapsed time and instantaneous heap samples. Measurements are observations, not an SLA or peak-memory claim.

## Support matrix

| Capability | Status and limit |
| --- | --- |
| Groups, FILLER, REDEFINES, partial writes | SUPPORTED in fixed DISPLAY/IBM1047 layout; shared physical base and exact interval proofs required. |
| RENAMES | SUPPORTED fixed proved partial/THROUGH views; no additional allocation. |
| Constant reference modification | SUPPORTED positive explicit position/length and bounded fixed bytes, including qualified identifiers. |
| Dynamic reference modification | CONSERVATIVE FALLBACK; no whole-item replacement. |
| MOVE adjustment/multiple receivers | SUPPORTED typed text fitting and ordered captures; overlapping source/receivers keep unknown values. |
| CORRESPONDING | SUPPORTED selected fixed textual pairs and exclusions; unsupported selected pairs keep fallback. |
| VALUE and entry state | PARTIAL: simple fixed literal under explicit INITIAL; UNKNOWN default, PRESERVED explicit; simultaneous conditions, no loop reseed. |
| External scopes | SUPPORTED AIR MAY/MUST, unions, outcome overrides and before-call point; PRIVATE alone does not prove disjointness. |
| Mixed storage | PARTIAL: exact local components coexist with unknown types/bindings/extents and explicit gaps. |
| RD and possible values | SUPPORTED regional intervals, partial kill, copies, entry supports and conservative joins within admitted control/codec forms. |
| CALL candidates | PARTIAL: computed bounded views/slices use regional values; model/source/effective/open-control remainders remain distinct. |
| General storage/runtime | UNSUPPORTED: OCCURS/ODO layout, COMP/NATIONAL codec, general LINKAGE/CALL USING mapping, interprocedural storage, dynamic offsets and unproved invocation lifecycle. |

Model, JSON transport, codec interpretation, CFG control, effects, RD, values and dependency interpretation are separate capabilities. Recognized codec/type/shape is not proof of executable precision. Unknown extent and ordinary operational exhaustion never become zero, empty closed values or completed delivery. Dense literal/text outputs retain unavoidable O(output bytes) cost; no arbitrary alias/candidate/receiver cap was added.

## Remaining boundaries

The six historical CardDemo blockers remain four EXEC preprocessing policy failures, one fixed-format tab and one invalid indicator in a copybook. Explicit AIR Diverge remains unsupported by the existing control profile. The opt-in future condition oracle is outside this storage scope. An overbroad discovery of archived CFG lifecycle tests produced 24 failures/15 errors against moved historical work records; current lean gates passed. Those raw failures are preserved and no history/gate was weakened.

Contract negatives cover closure/capability/bounds/provenance/size/corruption, stale snapshot ownership (T39), resource-limit categories and atomic destination preservation (T40). Source/SP, AIR model/codec and CFG/result contracts are independently checked.

Review order: air-java → proleap-poc → cobol-lower → analysis-cfg; analysis-ir unchanged. After human merges, repin consumers to actual merge SHAs in that order and run affected boundary checks. No merge or auto-merge was performed.
